Gazebo is a multirobot simulator for complex indoor and outdoor robotic simulation.
We can simulate complex robots, robot sensors, and a variety of 3D objects. Gazebo
already has simulation models of popular robots, sensors, and a variety of 3D objects
in their repository (https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/). We can
directly use these models without having the need to create.
